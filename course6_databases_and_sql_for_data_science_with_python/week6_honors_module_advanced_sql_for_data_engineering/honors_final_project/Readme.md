# Honours Final Project: Advanced SQL for Data Engineers

## Overview
- For this hands-on assignment, you will be working on several real-world datasets available from the Chicago Data Portal. You will be asked questions that will help you understand the data just like a data engineer would. You will be assessed both on the correctness of your SQL queries and results.
- You will write SQL code to create a view that limits the data available to a user, create a stored procedure that users can run to update Leader Icons in the table, and then enclose that update code in a transaction to ensure that if an error occurs, your data remains in a consistent state.
- Follow the instructions in the assignment to complete all the problems. Then share the Queries and Results with your peers for reviewing.
