# Neighborhood Segmentation and Clustering
In this module, you will learn about k-means clustering, which is a form of unsupervised learning. Then you will use clustering and the Foursquare API to segment and cluster the neighborhoods in the city of New York. Furthermore, you will learn how to scrape website and parse HTML code using the Python package Beautifulsoup, and convert data into a pandas dataframe.

### Learning Objectives
- Explain the purpose of data clustering.
- Describe the process of applying the k-means clustering algorithm to a dataset.
- Build a dashboard to analyze launch records interactively with Plotly Dash.
- Build an interactive map to analyze the launch site proximity with Folium.

# Peer-graded Assignment: Segmenting and Clustering Neighborhoods in Toronto

In this assignment, you will be required to explore, segment, and cluster the neighborhoods in the city of Toronto based on the postalcode and borough information. 

For the Toronto neighborhood data, a Wikipedia page exists that has all the information we need to explore and cluster the neighborhoods in Toronto. You will be required to scrape the Wikipedia page and wrangle the data, clean it, and then read it into a pandas  dataframe so that it is in a structured format like the New York dataset.

Once the data is in a structured format, you will make an analysis to the dataset to explore and cluster the neighborhoods in the city of Toronto.
