# Clustering
In this section, you will learn about different clustering approaches. You learn how to use clustering for customer segmentation, grouping same vehicles, and also clustering of weather stations. You understand 3 main types of clustering, including Partitioned-based Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, and Density-based Clustering.

### Learning Objectives
- Explain the different types of clustering algorithms and their use cases.
- Describe the K-Means Clustering technique.
- Describe accuracy concerns for the K-Means Clustering technique.
- Explain the Hierarchical Clustering technique.
- Provide an overview of the agglomerative algorithm for hierarchical clustering.
- List the advantages and disadvantages of using Hierarchical Clustering.
- Describe the capabilities of the density-based clustering called DBSCAN.
- Apply clustering on different types of datasets.
