# Python Programming Fundamentals
This module discusses Python fundamentals and begins with the concepts of conditions and branching. Continue through the module and learn how to implement loops to iterate over sequences, create functions to perform a specific task, perform exception handling to catch errors, and how classes are needed to create objects.

### Learning Objectives
- Classify conditions and branching by identifying structured scenarios with outputs.
- Apply your knowledge of conditions and branching by using JupyterLab.
- Use visual examples to understand for loops and while loops.
- Apply your knowledge of loops using JupyterLab.
- Explain what functions do.
- Build a function using inputs and outputs.
- Apply your knowledge of functions using JupyterLab.
- Demonstrate the use of exception handling using JupyterLab.
- Explain objects and classes by identifying data types and creating a class.
