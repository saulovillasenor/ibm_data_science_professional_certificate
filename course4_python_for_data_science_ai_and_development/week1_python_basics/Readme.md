# Python Basics
This module teaches the basics of Python and begins by exploring some of the different data types such as integers, real numbers, and strings. Continue with the module and learn how to use expressions in mathematical operations, store values in variables, and the many different ways to manipulate strings.

### Learning Objectives
- Demonstrate an understanding of types in python by converting/casting data types: strings, floats, integers.
- Interpret variables and solve expressions by applying mathematical operations.
- Build a program in JupyterLab to demonstrate your knowledge of types, expressions, and variables.
- Describe how to manipulate strings by using a variety of methods and operations.
- Apply your knowledge of strings using JupyterLab.
