# Final Project
In this project, you will complete a notebook where you will build a classifier to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not. You will load a historical dataset from previous loan applications, clean the data, and apply different classification algorithm on the data. You are expected to use the following algorithms to build your models: k-Nearest Neighbour, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression. The results are reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable: Jaccard index, F1-score and LogLoass.

### Learning Objectives
- Set up a Notebook in Watson Studio for your final project.
- Build a classifier to predict whether a loan case will be paid off.
- Share your project notebook and a complete project report.
- Evaluate the projects of your peers to provide a project grade.
