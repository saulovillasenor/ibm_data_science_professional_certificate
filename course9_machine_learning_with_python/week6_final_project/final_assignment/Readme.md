# Final Project: Loan Payment Prediction

## Classification with Python
In this project, we will complete a notebook where we will build a classifier to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not. We'll load a historical dataset from previous loan applications, clean the data, and apply different classification algorithms on the data. We load a dataset using Pandas library, and apply the following algorithms, and find the best one for this specific dataset by accuracy evaluation methods We are expected to use the following algorithms to build our models:

   - k-Nearest Neighbour
   - Decision Tree
   - Support Vector Machine
   - Logistic Regression

The results are reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:

   - Jaccard index
   - F1-score
   - LogLoass
