# Final Project
In the final project for this course, you will demonstrate the data visualization skills you have learnt by completing all modules. The assignment scenaro is that, as a data analyst, you have been given a task to monitor and report US domestic airline flights performance. The goal is to analyze the performance of the reporting airline to improve flight reliability thereby improving customer reliability. You will create a dashboard with two key report items: __Yearly airline performance report__ and __Yearly average flight delay statistics__ with a year range between 2005 and 2020.

This project was also created in another repository in order to deploy the application in a [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) server and make it available for anyone. Please follow this [link](https://us-flight-performance.herokuapp.com/) in order to see the app working in a server. If you wish to view the repository for the app please follow this [link](https://github.com/saulovillasenor/us_airline_flights_performance_dashboard), there you will find some important files to make the app work in Heroku.
