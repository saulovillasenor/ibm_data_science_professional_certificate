# Python Data Structures
This module begins a journey into Python data structures by explaining the use of lists and tuples and how they are able to store collections of data in a single variable. Next learn about dictionaries and how they function by storing data in pairs of keys and values, and end with Python sets to learn how this type of collection can appear in any order and will only contain unique elements.

### Learning Objectives
- Describe and manipulate tuple combinations and list data structures.
- Apply your knowledge of lists using JupyterLab.
- Apply your knowledge of tuples using JupyterLab.
- Write structures with correct keys and values to demonstrate understanding of dictionaries.
- Apply your knowledge of dictionaries using JupyterLab.
- Create sets to demonstrate understanding of the differences between sets, tuples, and lists.
- Apply your knowledge of sets using JupyterLab.
