# Final Assignment: Data Science Methodology (e-mails)

__Question 1.__ Which topic did you choose to apply the data science methodology to? __(2 marks)__
- I have chosen __e-mails__ as the topic to apply data science methodology to because I believe that by automatically classifying e-mails, productivity can be increased drastically as well.

Next, you will play the role of the client and the data scientist.

__Question 2.__ Using the topic that you selected, complete the Business Understanding stage by coming up with a problem that you would like to solve and phrasing it in the form of a question that you will use data to answer. __(3 marks)__
You are required to describe the problem, related to the topic you selected and to phrase the problem as a question to be answered using data. For example, using the food recipes use case discussed in the labs, the question that we defined was, "Can we automatically determine the cuisine of a given dish based on its ingredients?".

1. The employers of a certain company have been receiveing phishing emails with links which directs them to malicious places in the web, causing serious problems to the integrity of the companys data and resources.

2. Can we find a way to identify this phising emails to discard them and automatically block the senders?

__Question 3.__ Briefly explain how you would complete each of the following stages for the problem that you described in the Business Understanding stage, so that you are ultimately able to answer the question that you came up with. __(5 marks)__
Analytic Approach
Data Requirements
Data Collection
Data Understanding and Preparation
Modeling and Evaluation

1. __Analytic approach__. I would talk to the stakeholders in order to learn everything about their business and the email service they offer for their employes. How they use them, what kind of information they send, who they send the information to, etc.

2. __Data requirements__. I would identify where to get the data, which most probably be from the email database and the system logs. I would also figure out what will be the best format to get the data in.

3. __Data collection__. I would identify these mentined resources, where the data comes from, and start to extract the data by web scrapying, importing files and logs, or whatever method we find the most suitable according to where our data is and what format it is stored in.

4. __Data Understanding and Preparation__. I would clean the data to make an exploratory data analysis, then I would make some visual data representations and at the end would figure out what to do with null or wrong values to keep the integrity of my data.

5. __Modeling and Evaluation__. Once I got everything, I would see what is the best model to use. In this case we would need a classification predictive model. I'll develop it and once it is done will evaluate it with the stakeholders.
