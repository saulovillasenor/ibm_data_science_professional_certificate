# Regression 
In this week, you will get an introduction to regression. You learn about Linear, Non-linear, Simple and Multiple regression, and their applications. You apply all these methods on two different datasets, in the lab part. Also, you learn how to evaluate your regression model, and calculate its accuracy.

### Learning Objectives
- Demonstrate understanding of the basics of regression.
- Demonstrate understanding of simple linear regression.
- Describe approaches for evaluating regression models.
- Describe evaluation metrics for determining accuracy of regression models.
- Demonstrate understanding of multiple linear regression.
- Demonstrate understanding of non-linear regression.
- Apply Simple and Multiple, Linear and Non-Linear Regression on a dataset for estimation.
