# Classification
In this week, you will learn about classification technique. You practice with different classification algorithms, such as KNN, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression and SVM. Also, you learn about pros and cons of each method, and different classification accuracy metrics.

### Learning Objectives
- Compare and contrast the characteristics of different Classification methods.
- Explain how to apply the K Nearest Neighbors algorithm.
- Describe model evaluation metrics.
- Describe how a decision tree works.
- Outline how to build a decision tree.
- Explain the capabilities of logistic regression.
- Compare and contrast linear regression with logistic regression.
- Explain how to change the parameters of a logistic regression model.
- Describe the cost function and gradient descent in logistic regression.
- Provide an overview of the Support Vector Machine method.
- Apply Classification algorithms on various datasets to solve real world problems.
