# Final Assignment: What is Data Science and the Data Science Report Structure

__Question 1.__ Based on the videos and the reading material, how would you define a data scientist and data science? __(3 marks)__
- According to what I have learnt in this course, I would define a data scientist as a curious person who is interested in the answers about anything they see around them and who is able to use data science in order to solve some of these questions. It is important for a data scientist to have some technical skills like computational thinking, coding experience, basic math and satistical knowledge and so on, however the key skills for a data scientist are the curiosity and the ability to construct a powerful story to share their findings. Regarding data science, it is the analysis of large amounts of data which could not be analysed by traditional statistic methods, and because of this, it needs more advanced techniques like the use of some software, programming languages or big data clusters to process this big amount of data.

__Question 2.__ As discussed in the videos and the reading material, data science can be applied to problems across different industries. Give a brief explanation describing what industry  you are passionate about and would like to pursue a data science career in? __(2 marks)__
- As a nanotechnology engineer, I am excited about the incredible range of possibilities in which data science could be used in the area, like analysing large strains of proteins to find hidden patterns, doing some molecular simulations and creating models from them or studying the human genome. I also like interacting with people and telling stories, so in the moment I watched the videos and read the lectures on the report structure, I became intersted in making analysis to present these exciting results to big firms, companies or government dependencies.

__Question 3.__ Based on the videos and the reading material, what are the ten main components of a report that would be delivered at the end of a data science project? __(5 marks)__

The ten main components of a data science report could be listed as follows:
  1. The __cover page__. This is very important and sometimes data scientists give it for granted. It should contain at least the basic information about the report and the person who made it.
  2. The __table of contents__. It is a list of the differents headings and sub-headings of the work so that people have an idea of what they are going to read and also can find a specific subject of the work.
  3. The __abstract__. This is a brief and powerful explanation of the arguments of the author to persuade the reader to go into the work.
  4. The __introduction__. As its name suggests, it introduces the topic of the report to readers who might not be familiar with the matter. It also presents the problem and gives some context to it so that any person who reads it is on tune.
  5. The __literature review__. In this part the reporter gives a backgroung to his report and highlights the importance of his research by citing any previous works. He can also cite other papers to find some missing information on the subject and to make some questions and build his hypothesis.
  6. The __methodolody__. Here the reporter introduces the methods used to collect, analyse and model the data, as well as the research methods and any other technique he used througout the process. It is important to explain why a certain technique was chosen instead of others available.
  7. The __results__. This is the part of the report where the author presents his empirical findings and shares the formal testing of the hypothesis. It is important to use graphics, charts and illustrations to make it more appealing to the reader.
  8. The __discution__. Here is where the story telling comes into play as the reporter has to build the arguments which support the thesis he presented before. It is very important to expose any crucial findings like missing information or discovered patterns, and explain how our work helped on this.
  9. The __conclusions__. In this part of the report the general findings are presented in a very appealing and marketing fashion so that we solve any of the issues or complications presented in the discussion. The reporter may also explain how his work could be useful in the future for certain applications or research findings.
  10. The __references__. acknowledgement and appendices (in case appendices are needed). These are refered by doctor Haider to as the housekeeping of the paper and emphasizes that it is always good to ackowledge the support of others.
